Description: Inspired by Rich Caruana's "Ensemble Selection from Libraries of Models",
	     this is an implementation of it. Currently it only support regressions and 
	     no preprocessing on the data, I have plans to change this. Also looking to 
	     rewrite some of or all of it in Rcpp. Right now, the best models are determined
       by way of accuracy metric, this will also be exapnded to other metrics.
Suggests:
	caret
