totebag for R
=============

Current Version: v0.01
-------------

An implementation of Forward Ensemble Selection, particularly as shown in Carauan et al's excellent paper on the subject "Ensemble Selection from Libraries of Models" and related papers. There is still much to be done, the about-page is shown in the following section. Version 1.0 will be formally announced when I complete all the additional features.


To-Do
------
 > Enable other metrics than accuracy to be usedas measurements when doing ensembles
 > Rewrite when possible in C/C++
 > Add classification support
 > Add support for weighting models and/or some algorithm
 > To use models without formulas
 > Neural Network Compression (Possibly through another package?)
