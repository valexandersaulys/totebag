Currently it only support regressions and \n\t     no preprocessing on the data, I have plans to change this. Also looking to \n\t     rewrite some of or all of it in Rcpp. Right now, the best models are determined\n       by way of accuracy metric, this will also be exapnded to other metrics.\nSuggests:\n\tcaret\n",
